    - title: "Hugo"
      meta: "Framework for building websites"
      content: "It would not be an exaggeration if I said I love Hugo. It is a static site generator written with Go. Sure, it is targeted more towards developers but I believe it solves a lot of the problems the web and especially other dynamic site systems have. Namely speed, efficiency, and complexity."
