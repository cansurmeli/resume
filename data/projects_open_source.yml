    - title: Pedestrian Status
      meta: Real-Time Step Detection on iOS
      content: I later on published the most crucial part of Duco (my bachelor research thesis), i.e. step detection, as an open source project. Written with Swift, it utilises pedestrian dead reckoning to count the steps of the user while moving with his iPhone at hand. It is a proof-of-concept that the local iPhone sensors are highly capable of understanding movement.
