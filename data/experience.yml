      content: "For 11 months, I was part of a start-up named Voicity of which was in the travel space. We were working towards building a platform for tourists that would allow anyone to make/listen a recording on historical locations; kind of like a virtual tour guide that's always in your pocket. I was solely responsible for developing their iOS platform and foreseeing the development of Android and web backends.  However, due to my academic career choices, I had to travel to Germany for my master's degree so that I had to leave this start-up before publishing my work. Currently, any development/product of them does not reflect my own work."
