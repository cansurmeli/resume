    - title: "Analysing COVID-19: Forecasting with time-series data"
      meta: "MSc. Lecture Project"
      content: "This was another group project I've contributed to during my master's studies. We took the challenge of analysing COVID-19 time-series data to make various forecasts using various approaches such as ARIMA, ARIMAX, SARIMA and LSTM. Mainly, we had three research questions that we were trying to answer: Are there location specific trends in time-series data in between London and NYC, does weather conditions effect the COVID-19 spikes, and do the policy changes made by governments effect the spread of the virus?"

    - title: "Tweet Sentiment Extraction: Extract support phrases for sentiment labels"
      meta: "MSc. Lecture Project"
      content: "This was a group project and also a Kaggle challenge that I was a part of. We were given a dataset of Tweets with their sentiments(positive, negative, or neural) pre-determined. Our task was to find the phrase that caused the respective sentiment in the tweet. For this purpose, we've utilised a state-of-the-art Question & Answering model, namely RoBERTa. As a result, we've achieved a score of 0.71735 in word-level
      Jaccard score and we were placed within the best 5.93%."

    - title: Pedestrian Status
      meta: Open Source
      content: I later on published the most crucial part of Duco (my bachelor research thesis), i.e. step detection, as an open source project. Written with Swift, it utilises pedestrian dead reckoning to count the steps of the user while moving with his iPhone at hand. It is a proof-of-concept that the local iPhone sensors are highly capable of unserstanding movement.

    - title: "DUCO: Hybrid Indoor Navigation"
      meta: "Research Paper"
      content: "This is my bachelor's thesis presented as a research paper at MobiWis 2016 held in Vienna, Austria and published in `Lecture Notes in Computer Science` of Springer. I developed a hybrid solution for the problem of indoor navigation for iOS; mostly relying on pedestrian dead-reckoning(PDR) and some wireless technologies in the aid."
