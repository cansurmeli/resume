    - title: "Analysing COVID-19: Forecasting with time-series data"
      meta: "MSc. Lecture Project"
      content: "This was another group project I've contributed to during my master's studies. We took the challenge of analysing COVID-19 time-series data to make various forecasts using various approaches such as ARIMA, ARIMAX, SARIMA and LSTM. Mainly, we had three research questions that we were trying to answer: Are there location specific trends in time-series data in between London and NYC, does weather conditions effect the COVID-19 spikes, and do the policy changes made by governments effect the spread of the virus?"

    - title: "Tweet Sentiment Extraction: Extract support phrases for sentiment labels"
      meta: "MSc. Lecture Project"
      content: "This was a group project and also a Kaggle challenge that I was a part of. We were given a dataset of Tweets with their sentiments(positive, negative, or neural) pre-determined. Our task was to find the phrase that caused the respective sentiment in the tweet. For this purpose, we've utilised a state-of-the-art Question & Answering model, namely RoBERTa. As a result, we've achieved a score of 0.71735 in word-level
      Jaccard score and we were placed within the best 5.93%."
