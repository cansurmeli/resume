    - title: "Nginx Proxy"
      meta: "Automated Nginx Proxy for Docker"
      content: "This is a neat little Docker project that helps in using Nginx as a reverse proxy on your server. It also handles the creation and management of SSL certificates when enabled. I really enjoy having this project as it is simple yet powerful."

    - title: "Hugo"
      meta: "Framework for Building Websites"
      content: "It would not be an exaggeration if I said I love Hugo. It is a static site generator written with Go. Sure, it is targeted more towards developers but I believe it solves a lot of the problems of web and especially other dynamic site systems have. Namely speed, efficiency, and complexity."

    - title: "Shairport Sync"
      meta: "AirPlay (2) Audio Player"
      content: "I enjoy listening to music very much. It would be a shame if I trashed my old stereo since Apple does not really open source AirPlay. But hey, there is always Shairport Sync. It is a reverse engineering of both AirPlay and AirPlay 2 that turns your Raspberry Pi into a wireless music box."
