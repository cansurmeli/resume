My studies taught me a wide variety of subjects from data structures, algorithms, security, audio/image processing to networks, operating systems, hardware skills and more. During that time, I've worked with languages such as C, Java, Python, bash scripting, and Objective-C. Although these days, my main area of focus is Swift and Apple's ecosystem along with *nix administration and Docker. As a developer, I also deeply care about great UI/UX experiences. I'm a highly disciplined person who does not get comfortable with what he accomplishes, learns on his feet, and looks out for different ways to mould what he's already doing to better master it."

I was solely responsible for developing their iOS platform and foreseeing the development of Android and web backends.
